\description{
A dataset containing 1,000 hand-coded Tweets, drawn from \verb{[tw_data]}.
}
\details{
The dataset contains 1,000 Tweets which were drawn as stratified random sample from the population data \verb{[tw_data]}.
Each political party is represented with (at least) 120 Tweets. The populist parties AfD (250 Tweets) and Die Linke (150 Tweets)
were oversampled, as we anticipated more populist content from these parties.

TWo expert coders, one the author of this package, hand-coded the Tweets along two binary categories for populist communication:
Anti-elitism and people-centrism.

The coding followed the instructions documented in the online supplementary files of Thiele (2022).

90 Tweets were parallel-coded for reliability testing, resulting in Krippendorff's Alphas of .86 for anti-elitism, and
.71 for people-centrism, as documented by the variables \code{ane_A}, \code{ane_B}, \code{ppc_A}, and \code{ppc_B}.
